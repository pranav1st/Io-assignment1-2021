The API is called “Vehicle Information”, which gives information of the vehicles.
The API consists of two paths namely, “/data” and “/post”.
The “/data” path is a GET method which returns a sequence of characters, whereas the “/post” path is a PUT method using which the user enters the vehicle information.
